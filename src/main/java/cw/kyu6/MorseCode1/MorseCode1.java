/**
 * In this kata you have to write a simple Morse code decoder.
 * The Morse code is case-insensitive, traditionally capital letters are used.
 * When the message is written in Morse code, a single space is used to separate
 * the character codes and 3 spaces are used to separate words.
 *
 * NOTE: Extra spaces before or after the code have no meaning and should be ignored.
 * In addition to letters, digits and some punctuation, there are some special service
 * codes, the most notorious of those is the international distress signal SOS,
 * that is coded as ···−−−···. These special codes are treated as single special
 * characters, and usually are transmitted as separate words.
 *
 * Your task is to implement a function that would take the morse code as input
 * and return a decoded human-readable string.
 *
 * NOTE: For coding purposes you have to use ASCII characters . and -, not Unicode characters.
